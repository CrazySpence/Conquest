Conquest API
============

Connect to the server (port defaults to 9999) using tcp/ip sockets.

Sending and receiving to the server is done in an XML format.

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<message>
	<type>IRC</type>
	<user>Romulus</user>
	<cmd>person</cmd>
	<host>romulus@conquestgamesite.com</host>
	<msg></msg>
</message>

The actual XML sent/received from the server consists of a single line, 
followed by an either an ASCII 13 character(\n) for UNIX clients or an 
ASCII 10(\r) for Windows clients.  For example:

<?xml version="1.0"?><message><type>IRC</type><user>Romulus</user><cmd>person</cmd><host>romulus@conquestgamesite.com</host><msg></msg></message>\n

Here is a description for each of the tags:
<type>
The only supported types are IRC, MUD, or WEB.  Type only restricts certain 
operations on certain clients, like changing channel topics on IRC 
clients only.
<user>
User is the object being acted upon, usually a player's name.
<cmd>
Command is the operation to perform.  When sending to the server, it will 
contain the Conquest command the player wants to execute.
<host>
This is the hostname or IP address of the user.  The server always sends 
its own IP when responding.
<msg>
This is a generic field.  When sending to the server, it will contain 
parameters for the command being sent.  When coming from the server, it 
will consist of: <msg #>0x10<param1>0x10<param2>0x10...\n
There must be a 0x10 between each parameter.
The <msg #> cooresponds to the message numbers defined in the 
conquest.messages file.  The parameters must be inserted into the message 
where ever there is a %s and then the constructed message sent to <user>.
