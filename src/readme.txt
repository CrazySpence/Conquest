At long last, the "coveted" Conquest source code.  I have included a 
makefile for UNIX/Linux; for Windows, you will have to create a new 
WIN32 console application project (be sure to include wsock32.lib in the link 
options).

If you have questions as to how somethings works or why I did something a 
certain way, please feel free to email me (but bear in mind some of 
this code is 8 years old!).  If you make any changes, please 
let me know and I may update the pristine source I keep.
